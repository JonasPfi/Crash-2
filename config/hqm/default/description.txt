------MAT STATUS REPORT------

Welcome, and congratulations on remaining alive. You have survived a crash landing on Planet T4L0S, an uncharted planet in the Varkin system. Your shuttle was equipped with Multipurpose Assistance Terminal (MAT) technology. This MAT unit has now activated Emergency Survival Mode, designed to maximize your chances of survival in hostile or unknown environments. This terminal will provide situation-specific survival guidelines, continually monitor your vital signs, and record your progress for potential recovery operations.

T4L0S preliminary surface scans indicate an arid environment with pockets of elevated radiation and highly localized metal deposits. Surface coverage consists of dust with high mineral concentration. Subsurface scanning indicates abundant subterranean hydrocarbon reservoirs. Weak, intermittent life-sign readings are detected, but reliability is uncertain due to radiation interference.

Your embedded Heads-Up Display (HUD) provides real-time monitoring of the following:
- Vital signs
  - Body temperature
  - Hydration
  - Sustenance
  - Injury severity
- Nearby terrain mapping
- Object identification

Familiarize yourself with your environment, orient yourself, and begin to follow the tasks in the MAT "Basic Survival" guide.
