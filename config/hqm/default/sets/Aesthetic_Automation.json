            "text": "Brass Tunnels, which can only be placed on Mechanical Belts, serve multiple functions: they can be decorative, split item streams into multiple destinations, sort streams, or combine multiple item streams. Each tunnel has an input or output portal on each of its four sides, depending on the direction of the belt touching that side. When placed next to each other, multiple Brass Tunnels act as a group, collecting from all inputs and distributing to all outputs. This distribution is controlled by the tunnel’s value settings, and items can be split into various outputs using different modes such as Split, Forced Split, Round Robin, Forced Round Robin, and Randomize. For example, a stream of logs could be split, with some going to a furnace\u0027s fuel chamber and others to the smelting chamber. Forced Split ensures nearly equal distribution, while Forced Round Robin balances stacks across outputs. If a stream contains single items rather than stacks, these modes default to their round-robin counterparts for even distribution.\n\nBrass Tunnels can also filter items to specific outputs. Each output can have its own filter, ensuring that only items matching the filter will pass through it. Unfiltered outputs will pass all items that do not match any filter. This feature enables sorting systems where items are directed to particular outputs based on their filter settings. Additionally, Brass Tunnels can combine multiple input streams into one output. When multiple outputs are used, certain modes like Prefer Nearest or Synchronize Inputs will not merge the streams, while other modes will mix the streams accordingly. By combining Brass Funnels and Tunnels, a specific ratio of item types can be achieved, such as creating a balanced mix of copper and zinc ingots for use in a mixer.\n\n ",

To change the direction it sends items during crafting, simply right-click the front of the crafter with a Wrench. The connection between Mechanical Crafters is established through the path indicated by the block\u0027s design. In a setup, the crafters can be automatically filled by Funnels or Hoppers, and they can share inventories without being part of the same crafting recipe. A Wrench can also be used on the back and sides of Mechanical Crafters to connect or disconnect adjacent crafters\u0027 inventories. Items can be manually inserted or removed as well.\n\nEach Mechanical Crafter requires rotational power from either adjacent crafters or any size Cogwheel. This means that only one crafter in a setup needs to be powered by a Cogwheel for the entire system to work. Once powered, and when all the crafting slots are filled or a redstone signal is received, the Mechanical Crafters will send their items to adjacent crafters. To successfully craft an item, the components must eventually meet in one crafter, where they will turn into the final product. Crafter Slot Covers can act as empty spaces in a recipe, allowing for the connection of separate crafters, but they do not move the items themselves.\n\nIf the items do not form a valid recipe, the crafters will eject the items instead of crafting the product. For automating crafting, directly adjacent slots can be merged to hold a single item type, like andesite alloy. This allows the material to be fed in from the side via a hopper, streamlining the crafting process. Powered Mechanical Crafters will start crafting once all slots are filled or when a redstone signal is applied.\n\n\n\n",
